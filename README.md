### Summary 


For this assignment I was tasked with building the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

In the below walk-through video that I have demonstrated the functionality of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.
